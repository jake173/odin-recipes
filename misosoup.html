        <img src='./img/misosoup.jpeg' alt='A steamy miso soup bowl' width='300'>
        <p>Miso soup is  made with one of the basic broths in the japanese kitchen, <em>dashi</em>, and is made with <em>kombu</em> seaweed and <em>katsuobushi</em>. This broth can be purchased in asian shops named as <em>dashinomoto</em>, an instantaneous and very easy to make broth.</p>
        <p>The secret to this broth is not its taste but the amount of umami it has that helps to boost the taste of the rest of ingredients. This makes this broth very suitable for soups and sauces.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients for 2 people:</h2>
        <h3>Broth</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>50 g of onion</li>
            <li>20 g of ginger</li>
            <li>Konbu seaweed</li>
            <li>Katsuobushi (dehydrated tuna)</li>
            <li>2 sp of white miso</li>
            <li>50-100 g of tofu</li>
            <li>Shiitake</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Season</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Soy sauce</li>
            <li>Sesame oil</li>
            <li>Sesame seeds</li>
            <li>Pasta (Optional)</li>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <h3>Broth</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the kombu seaweed in water for 60-90 minutes until the seaweed has recovered its original size. Then, heat it at low flame to extract its flavour.</li>
            <li>Take out the seaweed and boil the liquid defoaming it to avoid impurities.</li>
            <li>Without any flame, the katsuobushi is put over the hot broth and when the strips sink, the liquid is strained. This first broth is called the <em>ichban dashi</em> and is used to make very clear and smooth soups and sauces.</li>
            <li>The seaweed and the tuna are put again into the pot with half of the amount of water as before and boiled for 30-40 minutes. This broth is called <em>niban dashi</em> and is the one used for making the miso soup.</li>
        </ol>
