        <p>The broth should be homemade when making risotto, to ensure the most flavorful results, but if time or circumstances make having homemade broth impossible, use the best canned broth you can find. Chicken, vegetable, fish and meat broths are all used depending on the other ingredients used in the dish.</p>
        <p>You could substitute another vegetable for the zucchini if you prefer, but this combination is as pretty as it is flavorful. Asparagus is another vegetable that works particularly well with the shrimp, and still has the pink and green color combination. Try and find small, young zucchini for the best flavor.</p>
